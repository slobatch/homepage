###Part I of II###

If you know me at all, you know that I'm not much for blogging. When I first started putting this site together, my girlfriend asked me, "What are _you_ going to blog about?" The fact of the matter is that I'm not sure. But just check [my bio](http://slobatch.github.bio) and you'll see that I wrote, "I always had way more fun building cool houses than actually playing with the Sims." This process has been similar in that way. 

I've never been good at keeping an up-to-date blog, but I was really drawn to the challenge of building one from scratch. I used to have a Blogger blog, and a Livejournal before that, but when I once tried putting together a Wordpress blog, I quickly became overwhelmed and failed miserably. Much later, while working with Radico, I was introduced to the concept of static site generators. They were using Pelican at the time, and I thought I'd give it a crack. Having just started working with git and Github at around the same time, I thought it would be perfect to host my personal page on Github Pages. I ran into a few issues, but they all culminated in the fact that, I simply couldn't quite figure out how Pelican worked. 

I think their were a handful of factors that contributed to my lack of succes:

1. Pelican's documentation was lacking.

1. I didn't understand how the Pelican files came together.

1. Github doesn't run Pelican. 

About two weeks ago, right around the time I began working at Knotable, I realized that as someone who was going to be joining the tech community, I needed to have a more respectable online presence. Up until that point, I had never really needed a personal website, and frankly didn't feel the need that it was something I wanted to spend time or money on (especially money). I made do with my Facebook, and my Twitter, my LinkedIn, and my about.me page.
