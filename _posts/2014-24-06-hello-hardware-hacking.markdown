About a week ago, Rahul Hirani (PM at Indicative) and I started talking about wanting to build things, and Makers, and [NYC Resistor](http://www.nycresistor.com/), and he mentioned that he had a bunch of Arduino and Raspberry Pi stuff lying around that he hasn't really played with in around a year. I told him that I'd never got near one of the things but was extraordinarily fascinated. 

This morning, he majorly delivered; he brought in a box of hardware hacking stuff, including an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, ethernet shield (really though, why are Arduino modules called shields?) a Raspberry Pi, a ton of wires and LEDs, and a copy of _Getting Started with Arduino_ by Massimo Banzi. I promised I would take good care of everything, and wouldn't lose anything.

So begins my adventure into this fun strange world. Hopefully it is a long and interesting one.
