#Part I of III: A Wartorn Past#

If you know me at all, you know that I'm not much for blogging. When I first started putting this site together, my girlfriend asked me, "What are _you_ going to blog about?" The fact of the matter is that I'm not sure. But just check [my bio](http://slobatch.github.bio) and you'll see that I wrote, "I always had way more fun building cool houses than actually playing with the Sims." This process has been similar in that way. 

I've never been good at keeping an up-to-date blog, but I was really drawn to the challenge of building one from scratch. I used to have a Blogger blog, and a Livejournal before that, but when I once tried putting together a Wordpress blog, I quickly became overwhelmed and failed miserably. Much later, while working with Radico, I was introduced to the concept of static site generators. They were using Pelican at the time, and I thought I'd give it a crack. Having just started working with git and Github at around the same time, I thought it would be perfect to host my personal page on Github Pages. I ran into a few issues, but they all culminated in the fact that, I simply couldn't quite figure out how Pelican worked. 

I think their were a handful of factors that contributed to my lack of succes:

1. Pelican's documentation was lacking.

1. I didn't understand how the Pelican files came together.

1. Github doesn't run Pelican. 

About three weeks ago, right around the time I began working at Knotable, I realized that as someone who was going to be joining the tech community, I needed to have a more respectable online presence. Up until that point, I had never really needed a personal website, and frankly didn't feel the need that it was something I wanted to spend time or money on (especially money). I made do with my Facebook, and my Twitter, my LinkedIn, and my about.me page, but I didn't have a single, legitimate destination on the Worldwide Web. 

First I challenged myself to create a clone of my about.me page from (almost) scratch in an afternoon. I pieced it together on my last day of work at Experiences Unlimited. None of the links were functional, but I had gotten the thing to look passably like my about.me page.

When I started thinking about navigation however, and what I would be linking to, I started thinking about this blog. I considered using [Medium](http://www.medium.com), but I was reluctant to start using another blogging service, and I was also reluctant to rely on embeds. 

After doing a quick search for _"Github blog"_, I found a Github [help page about Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages). On the one hand, I like things that are just supposed to work, and using trello had me truly fall in love with Markdown. But the words 'Static Site Generator' caused me to shudder in fear of the headache that Pelican had caused me.

**I accepted my own challenge of putting together a slightly more grown up website, using Jekyll, Github, and Bootstrap. If you're reading this, I have succeeded.**

So I began putting that little project together. I branched my old attempts at getting my Pelican site to work on Github off, and got to work on a brand new branch.
